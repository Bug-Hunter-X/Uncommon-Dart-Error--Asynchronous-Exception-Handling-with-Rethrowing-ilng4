# Uncommon Dart Error: Asynchronous Exception Handling with Rethrowing

This repository demonstrates a scenario involving an asynchronous operation in Dart that throws an exception.  The code showcases how to effectively handle various exception types, including the use of `rethrow` for handling errors at different levels of the call stack.  This addresses situations where you want to log or handle an error at one level, but also allow for further handling at a higher level.

## The Problem
Asynchronous operations in Dart often involve network calls or file I/O, which can result in unexpected errors.  Simply catching the `Exception` is not always enough, as different exceptions might require different handling.

## The Solution
The solution shows the importance of using specific `catch` blocks for specific exception types (such as `TimeoutException`, `FormatException`, `SocketException`).  By using `rethrow` after a general `catch`, the exception can still be handled by a higher-level `try...catch` block if necessary.
